## sbt project compiled with Scala 3

### Usage

You need  Java 17 and sbt 1.5.2 installed on your machine.
This is a normal sbt project, you juste need to run sbt on the root directory of the project. 
You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run` it will read the input.txt and output the result, and `sbt test` will run all the test suite for the mower.


For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).

I ran out of time of course and I could improve one million things about design, testing error handling ;)
Happy to discuss about it!
